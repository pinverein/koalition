I"Ì<p>Together we dance and create a space without exclusion and intolerance!</p>

<p>The dance project ‚Äú<strong>Voguing - Against Exclusion and Intolerance</strong>‚Äù is enabled through the cooperation of <a href="http://www.improperwalls.com">IMPROPER WALLS</a>, Karyin Cheng, <a href="http://www.gbstern.at/10">GB*10</a> and <em>pin</em>.
The project starts with an informational kickoff-event at the IMPROPER WALLS gallery on the 30th of September 2016. Subsequently a dance group, consisting of members of the cooperation partners and persons with experiences of displacement, will attend a course for two semesters (4.10.2016 - 15.06.2017) and learn how to ‚Äúvogue‚Äù from dancer and choreographer Karin Cheng in the facilities of the GB*10.
To conclude the project, IMPROPER WALLS and <em>pin</em> will host a ‚ÄúFinissage‚Äù to get together, reflect, dance and perform for friends and families.</p>

<p>Goals of this project are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To create a space without exclusion and intolerance</li>
  <li>To strengthen own and collective identities</li>
  <li>To encourage trust and feelings of security</li>
  <li>To encourage moments, where body and mind are the focus outside of daily routines, responsibilities or obligations as well as worries or social burden</li>
  <li>To dance!</li>
</ul>

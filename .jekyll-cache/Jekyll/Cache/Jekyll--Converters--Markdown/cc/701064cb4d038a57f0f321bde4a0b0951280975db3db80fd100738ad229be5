I"¨<p>A coalition of civil society actors points out anti-Muslim racism and warns against the erosion of basic democratic values.</p>

<p>Last Friday, May 7, 2021, the government surprisingly presented the â€˜finalâ€™ draft of the so-called â€˜anti-terror packageâ€™. At the time, reporting necessarily focused on femicides and their underlying causes, as well as on corruption scandals in Austria. Thus, a critical examination of the â€˜anti-terror packageâ€™ was largely absent. The new presentation of the â€˜Anti-Terror Packageâ€™ as well as the chosen approach of the government is the reason for the new civil society coalition against anti-Muslim racism to start its public relations work.</p>

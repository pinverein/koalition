      <em>pin – Organization for Participation, Integration and Networking</em> was founded in December 2015 and is as non-profit organization. It’s goal is structural and political change in society as a whole. Within this process, sustainable integration measures and support for structurally disadvantaged groups, as well as individuals, especially displaced persons, are priority. The members of <em>pin</em> are committed to being a part of the local integration network and their aim is to encourage social, economic and cultural integration by applying sustainable strategies – such as  promoting access to the labor market and education as well as raising public awareness.

        <div class="lead-text">

          We understand participation to mean active co-determination and participation in decision-making processes. This includes the contribution of ideas as well as the participation in projects, events and dialogue. One of our objectives is to encourage the cooperation of individuals, associations, organizations and institutions. We thereby  put focus on the attempt to continually speak to each other instead of for others.

        <div class="lead-text">

          For <em>pin</em>, integration, especially sustainable integration, stands for a dynamic, long-lasting and very differentiated process of growing together. This very process must be ensured by promoting the following foundational principles:

          <ul class='styled-list'>

            <li>multidimensional communication</li>
            <li>solidarity and understanding for the topics around displacement and migration, as well as according and relevant relationships</li>
            <li>“participate and let participate”</li>
            <li>integration in the educational sector and labor market</li>
            <li>equal opportunities and support through information and counseling</li>

        <h2 class="title-text">Networking</h2>
        <div class="lead-text">

          We take continuous and forward-looking participation, integration measures and networking as essential parts of sustainable structural change in society as a whole. Building a network, cooperating with organisations as well as individuals and consulting and involving people is one of <em>pin</em>'s main priorities. With our projects we aim to produce long-lasting effects and achieve effective problem-solving approaches through forward-looking thinking and action. We are convinced that social and structural changes cannot be achieved overnight, but through continuous work.

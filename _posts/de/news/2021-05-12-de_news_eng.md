A coalition of civil society actors points out anti-Muslim racism and warns against the erosion of basic democratic values.

Last Friday, May 7, 2021, the government surprisingly presented the 'final' draft of the so-called 'anti-terror package'. At the time, reporting necessarily focused on femicides and their underlying causes, as well as on corruption scandals in Austria. Thus, a critical examination of the 'anti-terror package' was largely absent. The new presentation of the 'Anti-Terror Package' as well as the chosen approach of the government is the reason for the new civil society coalition against anti-Muslim racism to start its public relations work.
